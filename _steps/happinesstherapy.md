In June 2009, the council [confirms](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/MajorProjectsBoard18June2009b.pdf) that 6 of the 15 replacement housing sites will no longer be built.

Instead of providing them with the new homes they were promised (or other suitable accommodation), Southwark decides to [offer residents 'Happiness therapy'](http://heygate.github.io/img/CouncilFlyerandLetter_HappinessTherapy.pdf) with TV happiness guru Robert Holden.
