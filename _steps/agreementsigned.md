After three years of stalled negotiations, the incoming Labour council leader signs the contractual agreement with Lendlease for redevelopment of the estate. The [agreement](http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) was subsequently leaked and it was [revealed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/15bn-revamp-of-sink-estate-reveals-social-cleansing-plan-8482307.html) that Southwark had sold the estate for £50m - much less than the [£150m it had valued the land at](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Overview%20&%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20070709/Agenda/Cover%20report.pdf) three years prior (para 14).
