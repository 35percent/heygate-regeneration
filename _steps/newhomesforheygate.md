As part of the new masterplan, Southwark identifies 15 council-owned sites (including play areas, a car park, a vacant nursing home) surrounding the Elephant & Castle, which it plans to hand over to housing associations in return for them building an element of 'social' housing for rehousing Heygate tenants.

In the foreword to the council's [information pack](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf) delivered to Heygate residents, Deputy council leader Catherine Bowman says: _"We have made sure that the construction of your new homes is the first thing that happens in this regeneration scheme."_
