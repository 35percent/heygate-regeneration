A [leaked internal report](http://heygate.github.io/img/Heygateweeklyhighlightreport.pdf) shows that by 31 Oct 2008, the estate has been half emptied and that most of the remaining residents are elderly. The report also highlights the difficulty of trying to decant 1,100 households into existing council properties when there are no more than 35 these becoming available every fortnight. 

198 ['notices to quit'](http://heygatewashome.org/img/NoticetoQuit.pdf) were issued to tenants during the decant.
