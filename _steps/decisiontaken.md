A decision is taken (behind closed doors) by Southwark's Regeneration chief Fred Manson to include the Heygate estate within the wider regeneration of Elephant & Castle. 
His report acknowledges that _'This overall proposal raises very big issues which involve a large number of different interest groups. Even raising such matters can lead to difficulties.'_
It therefore proposes to _'balance time for discussion of these matters with maintaining a momentum.'_

In March 1999, Fred Manson flew to [MIPIM](www.mipim.com) in the South of France - a property developers' jamboree, where he [described](http://35percent.org/img/pigsmightfly.pdf) the brief for Elephant and Castle as _“It’s a blank canvas – anything is possible – we can demolish houses, take away roads, anything.”_

In the same month he said in an interview: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_
