Southwark Council selects a development partner, property developer Godfrey Bradman and starts working up a masterplan for the regeneration. It is July 2000 before the plans are first presented to Heygate residents. 

Bradman delivers a [presentation](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/slrpresentation.pdf) to the Heygate TRA saying: _"This whole project is only possible by you, the Heygate residents. We understand that it is the redevelopment of the existing housing on the Heygate estate which provides the opportunity to regenerate the Elephant & Castle - and we are committed to providing new and better homes for you and your families who currently live here."_ 

Bradman's presentation promises _"100% reprovision of all the council homes currently on the Heygate estate"._ This is subsequently echoed in the [2002 masterplan](https://35percent.org/img/slrplans.pdf):
