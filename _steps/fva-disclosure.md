After a three-year legal battle, the Council is ordered to disclose the documents justifying Lendlease's departure from minimum affordable housing requirements.

The documents [show](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) that Lendlease had assumed an abnormally high profit margin (25%) and had significantly undervalued the end sales values of the completed development in order to make it look less viable. As a result, Southwark allowed Lendlease to renege on the affordable housing requirements set out in its planning policy and its [contractual partnership agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf). Of the 2924 new homes Lendlease is building on the redeveloped estate, just 100 will be let at social rent levels.
