In July 2007, the council executive [decided](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HeygateActionPlan.pdf) to bring forward the decant of the estate, despite the fact that not one of the 15 replacement 'early housing sites' had been completed. In response to protest, tenants demanded a legal document be drafted entitling them to a 'right to return' to the estate once it had been redeveloped. It later emerges that the [legal document](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/righttoreturn.pdf) drafted by the council contained a clause stating that the 'right to return' would expire after 7 years.
